title: Tumblr Themeing and another 'admire' product

I've had a bit of free time recently and have been increasingly attracted to creating themes for CMS's. I've created a few for Jekyll, Pico CMS and WordPress but none that are publishable yet, just learning the best ways and general experimenting.

Anyway, I thought I'd give Tumblr a crack as it's only one page and a little less long in the tooth, apart from the Vanilla CSS thing. I know there are a few plugins that get around the whole {AccentColor} thing (Tumblr templating syntax) for Sass but I'm yet to experiment with them. To be honest it was nice to write Vanilla CSS again and start remembering vendor-pre-fixes. It's been a while.

So, I created a theme. The theme was based on video initially and I'm sure it will develop into something that I will finally release, but at the moment I created it primarily for video.

I like to curate stuff I like and share those curated interests; that's where the whole 'Admire' thing was born. This project was incidently called 'Admiregraphy', simply a blog on Videography and Photography, mainly the former. I like a lot of stuff on Vimeo, literally like. So I set-up an IFFFT to auto-post to Tumblr when I like a video, cool.

I can then share with the world the videos I like in a nicely currated theme I made. Simple.

I will release the theme once I am happy, it will be called EXTOL. I'll let you work out how I came to that name, as with all my themes they use a secret formula for their theme names.
